# Surf Up

## <font color=#6495ED>Overview of Project</font>
We came up with a plan to open a Surf n’ Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream at Hawaii to locals and tourists. We have some savings that we are willing to invest. But we need real investor backing to get this off the ground. One of the investors wants information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


### <font color=#6495D>Purposes</font>

1. Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we’ll retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.
2. We will retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

## <font color=#6495ED>Summary</font>
* Temperatures on December are little lower than June, but not much, which means it's still warm on December。
* Precipatation on December are little more than June, but not much, which means it's still good on December.

* Since it's still warm and has light Precipatation on Decemebr, it's a good idea to open the shop all year long
